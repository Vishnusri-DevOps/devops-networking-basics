#  OSI Model – Explained for DevOps

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model has **7 layers** that explain how data travels through a network.

###  OSI Layers (Bottom to Top):
1. **Physical** – Cables, switches, electrical signals  
2. **Data Link** – MAC address, switches (Ethernet)  
3. **Network** – IP address, routers  
4. **Transport** – TCP/UDP, ports (e.g. 80, 443)  
5. **Session** – Manages sessions, connections  
6. **Presentation** – Data formats (encryption, encoding)  
7. **Application** – User-facing (HTTP, SSH, DNS)

###  Why DevOps Should Know This:
- Helps diagnose where a network issue occurs (e.g., is it DNS, IP, or routing?)
- Important when configuring firewalls, load balancers, and cloud networking (like AWS Security Groups)
