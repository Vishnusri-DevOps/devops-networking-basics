#  IP Addressing & Subnetting Basics

###  IP Address:
- Identifies a device on a network (e.g., 192.168.1.10)

###  Subnet Mask:
- Defines the network and host portion of the IP
- Example: `255.255.255.0` â†’ first 3 octets = network

###  CIDR Notation:
- Example: `192.168.1.0/24` means 256 IPs (254 usable)
- `/24` = 255.255.255.0

###  Use in DevOps:
- VPC and subnet configuration in AWS
- Access control between subnets or instances
- Reducing IP conflicts in private clouds
